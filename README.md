### Greetings

Welcome on my GitHub profile!

I'm a robotics researcher at the Technical University of Darmstadt focusing on ground robot navigation in rescue contexts (harsh and unknown terrain).  
However, for legacy reasons I also work a bit on UI and have released some cool libraries and plugins that help robotics enthusiasts to create great looking UIs.  
Open-Source libraries for UGV navigation will hopefully follow in the coming years.
