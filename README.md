### Greetings

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a robotics researcher at the Technical University of Darmstadt focusing on ground robot reconnaissance in rescue contexts (harsh and unknown terrain).  
The challenges include limited computational power, limited communication, harsh and unknown environments, and many more.
I am also doing some work on UI and have released some cool libraries and plugins that help robotics enthusiasts create great-looking UIs.  
Open-source libraries for UGV navigation will hopefully follow in the coming years.
